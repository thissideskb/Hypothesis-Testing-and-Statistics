- Null vs Alternative Hypotheses  
- Significance Level (α) and Decision Rules  
- Type I & Type II Errors  
- Z-test vs T-test comparison  
- Binomial Distribution Simulation & Visualization  
- Hypothesis Testing using Z-statistics  
- Confidence Interval estimation using Normal Distribution  
- Z-scores and their interpretation with visualizations  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Google Colab  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

## 📁 How to Use

1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab** or Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Run the cells step by step to see both theory and practical outputs.  
3. Explore the code examples to understand how statistical concepts are applied in real scenarios.
